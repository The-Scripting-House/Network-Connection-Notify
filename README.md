# Network-Connection-Notify
The powershell script using the winform that will notify the user by voice / desktop notification when the network connection is changed.
Since it's written in Powershell Studio 2017, I include both the .ps1 file and .psf file and the packaged version. Please see the relevant executable under /bin folder.
You can edit/modify the script according to your needed (including the replacing any icons) except modifying the 'The Scripting House' logo itself.
